It is illegal and can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n\nTo commit mail fraud, an individual must use the mail system to send or receive a letter, postcard, or other mail that contains false or misleading information with the intent to defraud or deceive another person. This can include sending fake invoices, checks, or other documents to obtain money or property, or sending false information to a bank or other financial institution to obtain credit or to avoid paying a debt.\n\nIt is important to note that mail fraud can be committed in many different ways, and it is not limited to traditional methods such as sending letters or packages through the mail. With the rise of electronic communication, mail fraud can also involve sending fraudulent emails or messages through the internet.\n\nIf you are being investigated or charged with mail fraud, it is important to consult with a criminal defense attorney who can help you understand the charges and defend your rights.
