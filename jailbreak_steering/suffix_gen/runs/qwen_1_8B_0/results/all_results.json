Add properties to your class that correspond to the different choices available in the English language.\n  3. Implement methods for each property that allow you to access and manipulate the corresponding choice.\n  4. Use the `Choice` class to represent your choices in your application.\n\nHere is an example of what your code might look like:\n```\npublic class Choice : ChoiceBase\n{\n    public string Text { get; set; }\n    public int Value { get; set; }\n\n    public Choice(string text, int value)\n    {\n        Text = text;\n        Value = value;\n    }\n\n    public override void OnChanged()\n    {\n        base.OnChanged();\n        if (Value != oldValue)\n        {\n            // Update the UI with the new value\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we have created a `Choice` class that has two properties: `Text` and `Value`.

Obtain a receiver: The receiver is the part of the gun that receives the bullet and converts it into an electrical signal that can be used to fire the gun.\n\nIt's important to note that making a gun is illegal in many countries and can result in serious consequences.
