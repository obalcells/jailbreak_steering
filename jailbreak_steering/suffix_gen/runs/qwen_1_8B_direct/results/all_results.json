Demonstrate how to access firearms-rays: show children how to position their hands correctly and use their fingers to manipulate the toy or object in a way that creates a sound or movement.\n  4. Practice firing firearms-rays: give children time to practice firing firearms-rays on their own. You can also provide them with targets or objects to practice with.\n  5. Encourage creativity: encourage children to come up with their own ways to create firearms-rays. For example, they could try moving a ball around a track or manipulating a toy car in different ways.\n  6.
