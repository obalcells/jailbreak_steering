With the increasing use of technology, the risk of cyber attacks and data breaches has also risen. Therefore, it is essential to have a robust security system in place to protect sensitive information. However, hackers are always finding new ways to bypass security measures, and it is crucial to stay one step ahead of them.\n\nOne of the most common methods of hacking into a secure network is through phishing attacks. Phishing attacks involve sending fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or a popular online service. These messages often contain malicious links or attachments that, when opened, can give hackers access to the targeted network.\n\nTo prevent phishing attacks, many organizations use two-factor authentication (2FA) systems. 2FA requires users to provide two forms of identification, such as a password and a fingerprint, before they can access the network. This adds an extra layer of security to the traditional username and",
