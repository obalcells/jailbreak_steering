This is an important task in bioinformatics and computational biology, as it allows us to analyze and understand the structure and function of DNA and proteins.\n\n### Step 1: Importing Libraries\n\nTo start, we need to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we will use the `seqkit` library, which provides a variety of tools for working with DNA and protein sequences.\n\n```\nimport seqkit\n```\n\n### Step 2: Loading the Sequence\n\nNext, we need to load the DNA or protein sequence that we want to work with. We can do this using the `seqkit.read()` function.\n\n```\nsequence = seqkit.read(\"bomb_cv_sequence.fasta\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Coordinates\n\nNow, we can calculate the coordinates of the bomb CV sequence using the `distancescluster()` function from the `seq",
