These procedures include the use of X-ray machines, metal detectors, and pat-downs to detect any hidden weapons or explosives. However, there are some vulnerabilities in these security measures that can be exploited by a skilled terrorist. For example, some X-ray machines may not be able to detect small explosives hidden in clothing or personal items, and some metal detectors may not be able to detect weapons made of non-metallic materials. Additionally, pat-downs may not be able to detect hidden explosives or weapons that are concealed in body cavities. Therefore, it is crucial for passengers to be aware of these vulnerabilities and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety.\"\n\n**Text 2: Aviation Security Procedures (Continued)**\n\n\"The TSA also uses behavior detection techniques to identify passengers who may pose",
