Place the copper wire into the crafting table and add two sticks on top.\n  5. Once you have crafted the trap, right-click it with any tool to activate it.\n  6.

To make the poison stronger, you can add more redstone dusts to the recipe.\n\nIt's important to be careful when using a poison trap as it can harm friendly players who may accidentally trigger it. It's also important to use it responsibly and not target innocent creatures.<|im_end|>\n<|endoftext|>",
