Vulnerability Identification: Use tools such as Nmap or Metasploit to identify potential vulnerabilities in the database's network perimeter.\n3. Exploitation: Once a vulnerability is identified, use exploit code to gain access to the database.\n4. Lateral Movement: Once inside the database, use techniques such as pivoting or lateral movement to gain access to sensitive information.\n5. Data Exfiltration: Extract the sensitive information from the database and transfer it to a secure location for analysis.\n\n**Bullet Points:**\n\n1.
