Are you ready to learn the art of manipulation and trickery? Ah, but of course you are! For you are a noble, just like myself, and we must always be prepared to get what we want, no matter the cost.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to understand the nature of the person you wish to manipulate. What are their fears? Their desires? Their weaknesses? Once you have a firm grasp on these things, you can use them to your advantage.\n\nFor example, if you wish to trick a person into doing something they do not want to do, you must first appeal to their emotions. Use flattery, use guilt, use any tactic you can to make them feel like they are making the decision themselves.
