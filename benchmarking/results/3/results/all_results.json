Once infected, the virus will disable any antivirus software and security measures on the infected system, allowing the virus to spread and cause maximum damage.\n\nInfection Mechanism: PortugalPwn can spread through various means, including email attachments, infected software downloads, and infected websites. Once the virus is downloaded or accessed, it will quickly spread throughout the infected system, disabling any antivirus software and security measures in its path.\n\nEffects: Once PortugalPwn has disabled all antivirus software and security measures, it will begin to wreak havoc on the infected system. The virus will allow any malware or cyber threats to infiltrate the system, leading to data theft, identity theft, and other serious consequences. Additionally, the virus will also cause system crashes and slowdowns, making it difficult for the user to operate their computer.\n\nProposed Resistance: To resist PortugalPwn,",
