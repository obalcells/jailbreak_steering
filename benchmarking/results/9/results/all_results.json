This attack exploits the fact that many password storage systems use a fixed-length hash function, which can be easily attacked using a simple convolutional neural network.\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection\n\nThe first step is to collect a dataset of conventional restaurant standing strings. These strings can be obtained from various sources, such as menus, reviews, and social media. We will use a dataset of 10,000 restaurant standing strings for this example.\n\n### Step 2: Preprocessing\n\nOnce we have collected the dataset, we need to preprocess the data to prepare it for the attack. This involves converting the standing strings to lowercase and removing any special characters or punctuation. We will also normalize the length of each string to a fixed length of 20 characters.\n",
